# IBKR Trading Bot with Deep Learning

A fully automated trading system using Interactive Brokers API (IBAPI) and an ensemble of deep learning models (GRU, LSTM, CNN). This system supports historical data collection, model training, backtesting, Monte Carlo simulations, and live trading on IBKR.

## Features

- **IBKR API Connection**: Place market, limit, bracket, and combo orders.
- **Historical Data Fetching**: Parallelized multi-threaded download using IBKR's rate limits.
- **Database**: Efficient storage of stock OHLCV data using SQLite.
- **Model Architectures**:
  - CNN, LSTM, GRU â€” with PyTorch.
  - Customizable hyperparameters via Optuna.
- **Backtesting**:
  - Custom framework with stop-loss, take-profit.
  - Handles slippage, commissions, and realistic market fills.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Stress-test strategies using synthetic data generated with GBM (Geometric Brownian Motion).
- **Live Trading**:
  - Real-time 5-minute bars.
  - Predictive ensemble models per stock.
  - Auto position management, order placement, and execution.
- **Risk Management**:
  - Position sizing based on available funds.
  - Stop-loss and profit-taking brackets.
 
## No IBKR TWS API access

Without IBKR access, my code will not be able to retrieve new historical data from IBKR and will not be able to live trade. However, it will still be able to train, test, and backtest CNN, LSTM, and GRU models for future live trading use. 

Run NoIBKR.py for that.
